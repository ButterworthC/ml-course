<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
<p>
In this unit we were introduced to Schwab &amp; Zahid's paper on the impact of machine learning on the workplace and future levels of employment.
The lecturecast described the effect of technology in bringing about <i>Industry 4.0</i>, a concept described as <i>cyber-physical systems</i> (Schwab &amp; Zahid, 2020).
Supervised and unsupervised machine learning were mentioned briefly, as were the 4 V's of big data (Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity).

<h3>Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Much of this unit involved preparation for the collaborative discussion on Industry 4.0, the upcoming team data analysis project, and the e-Portfolio.
We were directed to a notebook which demonstrates EDA. Unfortunately I was unable to find this in Google Colab so I found a similar notebook and dataset in Kaggle.<br>
I looked for relationships between the prices of cars and their number of cylinders, horsepower, fuel efficiency etc., and produced scatter plots and a correlation matrix.<br>
The notebook is <a href="">Unit 2 Kaggle EDA.ipynb</a> and the dataset is <a href="">kaggle_car_data_for_eda.csv</a>

<h3>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h3>
